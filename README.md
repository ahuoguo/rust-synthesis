# rust-synthesis
A bottom-up synthesizer written in rust. I followed Nadia's algorithm instead of the one from the bustle paper. I did not find a crate that allows generics for generators 
(or functions that has `yield`) so I made a fake attempt for generic support...

I might switch to the bustle algorithm to support generics...
